/*
 * Problem 4 (inflation):
 * It is difficult to make a budget that spans several years, because prices are not stable.
 * If your company needs 200 pencils per year, you cannot simply use this yearâ€™s price
 * as the cost of pencils two years from now.
 * Because of inflation the cost is likely to be higher than it is today.
 *
 * Write a program to gauge the expected cost of an item in a specified number of years.
 *
 * The program asks for
 * 	the cost of the item,
 * 	the number of years from now that the item will be purchased,
 * 	and the rate of inflation.
 *
 * The program then outputs the estimated cost of the item after the specified period.
 *
 * Have the user enter the inflation rate as a percentage, such as 5.6 (percent).
 *
 * Your program should then convert the percentage to a fraction, such as 0.056,
 * and should use a loop to estimate the price adjusted for inflation.
